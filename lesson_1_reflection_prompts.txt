How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By using diff we can find diffrece b/w two files
    so if there is some typo or any other diffrece we can find 
    that easily with the help of diff command.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By having a entrie history of file we can check what changes are done till now,
    and if you don't like your current version you can go to your previous version.
    for programmer if your code generate some error and now you want to access
    that code version that is running perfectly by using version control you can access
    that code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros of manually choosing to commit-
    your commit history don't get clutter with your commit history.
    you can commint when you have a logical change in your code.
    it would be easiar to work in collobaration with only contain logical commit.
    
    cons-
    you have to decide when to make a commit so this give use a flexibility so in this
    user can make several commit and fill history with many commits that is not important.

    pros of version automatically saved-
    you don't have to worry about when to save.

    cons-
    it saved that version that is not necessary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think because change in one file related to other files so it makes sense to 
    allow saving multiple files in one commit. a single logical change affect more than 
    one files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - git log use to see the commit history
    git diff - git diff use to find diffrence b/w two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    using version control make user more confident to make change because
    by using version control it removes the fear of breaking your code.
    you can which version is that,that cause the problem in your code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To make my own personal projects.
